  <h3>Overview</h3>
  
  <p> This project will consist of a large dataset including images from
    20 different categories. Your task is to identify key distinguishing 
    features of these images and
    develop models to classify them in Python. To successfully 
    train a classifier we need to do 
     data cleaning, feature exploration, 
    model parameter selection, and model selection. 
    In this project, you will do all of these steps. 
    You will extract different image features, 
    visualize those features, train several models, and 
    explain the process in a report. Most of the concepts, 
    like feature extraction and visualization, 
    are already taught in the class. The classification techniques will 
    be covered soon. We recommend that you start working 
    on the project as early as possible. 
  </p>

<h3>Description</h3>

  <ol>
      
      <li style="margin-bottom:2em"><b>Feature Extraction:</b>
        The first step for a classification task is identifying 
        discriminative features. 
        For this, you can use simple features like image intensity 
        or you can extract more sophisticated features like 
        the convolutional neural network (CNN) based features. 
        Additionally, you can use 
        either a single channel or all three color channels for 
        feature computation (image color can sometimes provide an additional 
        cue for classification). 
        Write separate Python functions to extract 
        each of the following image 
        features given an RGB image as input: 
        <ol>
          <li> Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): This is the 
            feature you learned in the class. You can use Python's 
          sklearn library for extracting this feature. 
          In your report, 
          include plot(s) 
        visualizing the HOG features for an image and 
        explain how you decided 
      the size of the window for HOG computation. </li>
          <li> Harris Corner Features: As you learned during motion estimation, 
            image corners are robust features for tracking. One way to detect 
            corners is by using an algorithm by Chris Harris & Mike Stephens, 
            Harris corner detector (suggested 
            <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_features_harris/py_features_harris.html#harris-corners">reading</a>).
            Again, you can use Python's sklearn or OpenCV implementation of Harris 
            Corner detection algorithms. In your report, include plot(s) 
            visualizing these features for an image and explain how you selected 
            different parameters for the detector. 
          </li>
          <li> Two features of your choice: Implement two additional features of 
            your choice which can help in the classification task. These features can 
            be as simple as image intensity or state-of-the-art image 
            classification features extracted using 
            a CNN pre-trained on ImageNet. 
            In your report, 
            include plot(s) in order to explain the features 
            you implemented and why you selected these features. 

          </li>
        </ol>
        
      </li>

      <li style="margin-bottom:2em"><b>Feature Visualization:</b>
        Load the images given <a href="20_categories_training.zip">here</a>. 
        The images are divided into 20 categoreis. 
        Visualize the above features for these images on 2-D plots. 
        As these features are 
        high dimensional, you will need to reduce the dimensionality of 
        these features. Remember PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction. 
        You can use any of these dimensionality reduction techniques 
        for visualizing the features on a 2-D plot. You can use only a small 
         set of images from each of the 20 categories. Use Python's 
        sklearn library for t-SNE or PCA. 
        In the 2-D plot, 
        use different colors to represent images 
        from different categories.
        In your report, include plot(s) to show the visualization of the features 
        (you can also use combination of multiple features) on 2-D plot. Explain 
        which features and dimensionality reduction technique 
        you used for the plots and why. Also, explain if there is anything 
        interesting you observed while exploring the features. 
      </li>

      <li style="margin-bottom:2em"><b>Image Classification:</b>
        Split the images from each category into training and validation dataset. 
        Generally, it is done by randomly selecting 80% images from 
        each class for training and 20% for validation. You will 
        train the models using training data, 
        tune the hyper-parameters for the classifiers using 
        validation dataset. You will train multiple classification models here. 
        For each classification model, 
        you can use sklearn library 
        functions. Use the following classification techniques that you learned 
        in the class using the features you implemented above: 
        Logistic Regression, nearest-neighbor clustering, 
        SVM, and CNN (optional). Use the validation set 
        to compute the 
        accuracy throughout the process, with and without different features,
        optimizing as much as possible. Use tricks like cross-validation and 
        hyper-parameter tuning to ensure your model is generalizing to 
        validation dataset.
          
      </li>

    <li>Run the model of your choice 
      (that gives the best accuracy on the validation data) on the test data 
      given <a href=20_test.zip>here</a>. Generate a csv of
      classification results for all the images. The csv will have 
      two columns: name and label that specify the image name and 
      the output class label. Include this csv in your 
    submission.</li>

  </ol>

<h3>Deliverables</h3>

<p>You will submit your code, classification results on 
  test data, and a report. 
  In the report (maximum three pages), 
  you will explain the process and things you learned in the 
  project. 
  You will be graded on the correctness of the code, 
  clarity of your report, and your model accuracy on the test data. </p>
